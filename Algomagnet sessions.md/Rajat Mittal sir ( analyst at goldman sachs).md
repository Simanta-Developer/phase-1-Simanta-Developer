### :high_brightness: Some tips on gsoc by Rajat mittal sir:
:point_right: First we should learn about the orgainisation and their code base for about 1st month.</br>
:point_right: From the 2nd month we should try to contribute in it and improve our documentation skills.</br>
:point_right: From the 3rd month we should be doing some active project and keep contributing to project and open source.</br>
:point_right: We should start as early as possible, i.e from dec - january.</br> 
:point_right: gsoc helps in building connection with similar minded people and it will give good experience about the open - source.

## :high_brightness: Some valuable insights by Rajat mittal sir:
:point_right: We should do opensource as it will differenciate us from others as most of people dont have idea what open source is.</br>
:point_right: Practice competitive programming.</br>
:point_right: 2nd year of college is the ideal year to explore these things but its never too late to start these things in 3rd year of college.</br>
:point_right: Always be prepared and keep an hawk - eye on internship session, i.e july - september.</br>
:point_right: Google and microsoft keep posting oppurtunity, keep an eye on it.</br> 
:point_right: He sugessted about some of the open source platforms like [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/).

## :high_brightness: Some highlights about the meeting :
:fire: The theme of the meeting was **how opensource imparts value in our college life**.</br>
:fire: I was *speech evaluator 1* for the meeting.</br>
:fire:  Q/A round was also held at the last part of the session.

## At last I want to thank Rajat Mittal sir(cheif guest), Ankit sir and all my algomagnet team to conclude the meeting successfully.:smile:
