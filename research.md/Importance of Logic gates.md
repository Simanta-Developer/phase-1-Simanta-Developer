## :boom: Logic gate :
[Logic gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) is an idealized [model of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation) or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function.
#### Types of logic gates :
>> NOT
>> 
>> AND
>> 
>> OR
>> 
>> NAND
>> 
>> NOR
>> 
>> XOR / Exclusive OR
>> 
>> Exclusive NOR



## :boom: Importance of logic gates :
1. Used to carry out logical operations on single or multiple binary inputs and give one binary output.
2. Used in many electronic devices such as safety thermostat, push-button lock, automatic watering system, light-activated burglar alarm etc.
3. Regulate the flow of electricity through an electronic circuit by receiving and modifying binary input and output.
