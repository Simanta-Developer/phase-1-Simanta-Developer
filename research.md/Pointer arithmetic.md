# :boom: Pointer arithmetic :
* We can perform arithmetic operation on pointers which is called [pointer arithmetic](https://www.javatpoint.com/pointer-arithmetic-in-c).
* Pointer contains the address, the result of an arithmetic operation performed on the pointer will also be a pointer if the other operand is of type integer.
* In pointer-from-pointer subtraction, the result will be an integer value.
* Following arithmetic operations are possible on the pointer in C language:

>> Increment
>> 
>> Decrement
>> 
>> Addition
>> 
>> Subtraction
>> 
>> Comparison
* Illegal arithmetic with pointers :
>> Address + Address = illegal
>> 
>> Address * Address = illegal
>> 
>> Address % Address = illegal
>> 
>> Address / Address = illegal
>> 
>> Address & Address = illegal
>> 
>> Address ^ Address = illegal
>> 
>> Address | Address = illegal
>> 
>> ~Address = illegal
