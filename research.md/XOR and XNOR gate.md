## :boom: XOR gate : 
* [XOR gate](https://www.javatpoint.com/xor-gate-in-digital-electronics) stands for exclusive OR gate.
* The output of the XOR gate is high(1) only when both the inputs are different from each other.
## :boom: XNOR gate :
* [XNOR gate]() stands for inclusive OR gate
* The output of the XNOR gate is high(1) only when both the inputs are same.
## :boom: Relevance of XOR and XNOR gate :
1. **XOR gate** is used to construct digital circuits that perform arithmetic operations and calculations. Especially [Adders and Half-Adders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)),as they can provide a "carry-bit" function or as a [controlled inverter](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/docs/2.1.0/libs/gates/controlled.html).
2. **XNOR gate** are used mainly in electronic circuits that perform arithmetic operations and data checking such as Adders , Subtractors or [Parity Checkers](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1803/parity-check) etc.
3. As the **XNOR** gate gives an output of logic level "1", whenever its two inputs are equal, it can be used to compare the magnitude of two binary digits or numbers and so Ex-NOR gates are used in [Digital Comparator circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_comparator).
