# :boom: Generic pointers :
* When a variable is declared as being a pointer to type void, it is known as a [generic pointer](https://www.atnyla.com/tutorial/void-generic-pointers/1/371).
* Also known as **void pointer**.
# :boom: Why it is important :
* If we need to declare integer pointer, character pointer and float pointer then we need to declare 3 pointer variables.
* Instead of declaring different types of pointer variable it is feasible to declare single pointer variable which can act as an integer pointer, character pointer.
* Hence we use generic pointer.
# :boom: Declaration of generic pointers :
* It is declared as :  ***void * pointer_name;*** .
