## :boom: Space :
* In computer programming, [space or whitespace character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character) is any character or series of characters that represent horizontal or vertical space in typography.
* A whitespace character does not correspond to a visible mark, but typically does occupy an area on a page. It has [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) value of 32.
#### Relevance of space :
1. In programming language syntax, spaces are frequently used to explicitly separate [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Token).
2. Web markup languages such as [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) treat whitespace characters specially, including space characters.
3. Some markup languages, such as [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language), preserve whitespace as written.
4. In commands processed by command processors, e.g., in scripts and typed in, the space character can cause problems as it has two possible functions: as part of a command or parameter, or as a parameter or name separator. Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces, or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters.
## :boom: Indentation :
* In the written form of many languages, an [indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_(typesetting)) or indent is an empty space at the beginning of a line to signal the start of a new paragraph. 
* In computer programming, an [indentation style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style) is a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey program structure.
#### Relevance of indentation :
1. indentation helps better convey the structure of a program to human readers.
2. Some languages (such as Python) use indentation to determine the structure instead of using braces or keywords, this is termed the [off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule).
