# :boom: LaTeX
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) is a [software system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system) for document preparation.
* It uses [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) as opposed to the [formatted text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text).
* The writer uses [markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and  letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references.
* LaTeX uses the [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.
* LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system, or as an intermediate format, such as it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating [DocBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook) and other [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)-based formats to PDF.
* LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields,including mathematics,statistics,computer science and in publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek.
