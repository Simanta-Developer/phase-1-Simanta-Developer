# :boom: Zero Indexing :
* Zero-indexing is a way of numbering in which the initial element of a sequence is assigned the index 0.
* In other places, such as in measurement [zero based numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering) is used.
# :boom: Why it is important:
* An array arr[i] is interpreted as *(arr+i). Here, arr denotes the address of the first array element or the 0 index element. So *(arr+i) means the element at i distance from the first element of the array. So array index starts from 0 as initially i is 0 which means the first element of the array.
