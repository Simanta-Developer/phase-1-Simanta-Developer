# :boom: What is C ?
* C is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) developed at AT & Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972 by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie).
* Constants also called literals is that entity that doesn't change.
* Variables are also called identifiers is that entity that changes.
* There are two types of constants :
1. **Primary constants :** 
>> * Integer constant </br>
>> * Real constant </br>
>> * character constant
2. **secondary constants :**
>> * Array
>> * Pointer
>> * structure etc.
* In a char constant, both quotes must slant to the left, like 'A'.
* **Variables** have two meanings: 
1. It is an entity whose value can be changed.
2. It is a name given t the location in memory.
* Variable names are case-sensitive and must begin with an alphabet or underscore.
* **Keywords** are the words which conveys special meaning to the programming language. There are total 32 keywords. Examples are : int,if,struct etc.
* **printf()** is a library function which displays output on the screen. The general form of printf() is **printf("format string",list of variables)**.
* **Format string** may contain :
>> * %f for printing real values </br>
>> * %d for printing integer values </br>
>> * %c for printing character values
* **scanf()** is a library function which receives keyboard input from the user.
* **Ampersand(&)** denotes *address of* operator. It gives the location number(address) used by the variable in memory.
* **main()** is a function that must always return a integer value. 0 indicates success and non-zero number if main() is fail to do intended work.
* **Comments** is used in a C program to convey some information to the program which is ignorged by the compilier for execution. Use /* ... */ for comment.
